💕:- Day 1 is about understanding the full ML pipeline, not leaderboard score. Your focus is hands-on learning.

Step-by-Step Kaggle Titanic Plan:

Step 1 – Load & Understand Data (30–45 min)
    • Load CSV using Pandas
    • Check first 5 rows: df.head()
    • Understand features and target (Survived)
    • Check for missing values: df.isnull().sum()

Step 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (1 hr)
    • Visualize numerical features: Age, Fare
        - Histograms, boxplots
    • Visualize categorical features: Sex, Pclass, Embarked
        - Countplots
    • Identify trends: Who survived more?

Step 3 – Feature Engineering (1 hr)
    • Extract titles from Name (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.)
    • Combine SibSp + Parch → FamilySize
    • Encode categorical features (Sex, Embarked)

Step 4 – Train/Test Split (30 min)
    • Use train_test_split from sklearn
    • Typical split: 80% train / 20% test

Step 5 – Train Baseline Model (1 hr)
    • Logistic Regression → baseline model
    • Random Forest → stronger model

Step 6 – Evaluate Model (30 min)
    • Accuracy score
    • Confusion matrix
    • Discuss errors briefly

Step 7 – Kaggle Submission (30 min)
    • Predict on test.csv
    • Submit your first Kaggle prediction
